### NGINX — Short, Production-Focused Note

### What NGINX Is
#### NGINX is a high-performance, event-driven web server commonly used as:
* Reverse Proxy
* Load Balancer
* Static File Server
* API Gateway
* TLS Termination Point
#### Its asynchronous, non-blocking architecture makes it ideal for heavy concurrent traffic (SRE/DevOps critical).
